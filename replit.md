# Android IPTV Player

## Overview
Native Android video player application using Media3 (ExoPlayer) for IPTV playlist playback with advanced codec support. Designed to work with Flussonic Media Server using built-in token authentication.

## Project Structure

### Android App (`/app`)
- **Native Android application** with Media3/ExoPlayer
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Key Features**:
  - M3U/M3U8 IPTV playlist loading (manual upload or URL)
  - ALL audio/video formats via FFmpeg (MP2, ADTS, AAC, H264, etc.)
  - Phone-optimized touch interface (tap screen to show/hide controls)
  - Fullscreen playback with auto-hiding UI
  - Independent playlist toggle button (bottom-left)
  - Channel info display (always visible during playback)
  - Auto-advance to next video
  - Repeat all mode
  - Vertical scrolling playlist with logos
  - All subtitles disabled
  - On-screen debug log with decoder diagnostics (toggle in Settings)

## Dependencies

### Android (Media3)
- `androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer:1.8.0`
- `androidx.media3:media3-ui:1.8.0`
- `androidx.media3:media3-common:1.8.0`
- `androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-dash:1.8.0`
- `androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-hls:1.8.0`
- `org.jellyfin.media3:media3-ffmpeg-decoder:1.8.0+1` (for MP2/mp2a audio codec support)

## Building the Android App

**GitHub Actions**: This project uses GitHub Actions for automated APK builds. 
- Push to GitHub and the workflow will automatically build `rutv-debug-1.3.apk`
- Download the APK from GitHub Actions artifacts under "rutv-debug-apk"
- **Updatable APK**: Uses consistent debug.keystore for all builds - update without uninstalling!

**Local Build** (requires Android SDK):
1. Open project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Build APK: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
4. Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/rutv-debug-1.2.apk`

Or run directly on emulator/physical device from Android Studio.

**For Future Updates**: 
- Increment `versionCode` in app/build.gradle (currently: 4)
- Update `versionName` (currently: "1.3")
- Update APK filename in GitHub Actions workflow
- Keep `debug.keystore` file for consistent signing

## Playlist Support

The player supports M3U/M3U8 format playlists with:
- Channel names and metadata
- Channel logos
- Group/category organization
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video sources
- IPTV playlists

### Loading Playlists
- **Settings Button**: Tap the âš™ icon (bottom right) to access settings
- **Upload File**: Select M3U/M3U8 file from device - stored permanently on device
- **Playlist URL**: Enter M3U8 URL - reloads automatically on app start
- Auto-loads last configured playlist on startup
- Supports 300+ channel playlists with logos and categories

## Recent Changes

### October 6, 2025 (Latest - Version 1.3 - UI/UX Improvements)
- **Tap-to-Show Controls**: Tap screen to show/hide bottom control buttons and logo (uses PlayerView's built-in controller)
- **Channel List Button**: New playlist button (ðŸ“‹ icon) in bottom-left corner toggles channel list visibility independently
- **Smart Playlist State**: Playlist visibility preference preserved across controller show/hide cycles using `playlistUserVisible` flag
- **Channel Info Display**: Shows "#[number] â€¢ [channel name]" at top center during playback (visible even when controls hidden)
- **Auto-play Fix**: Channel selection now calls `prepare()` and sets `playWhenReady = true` to ensure playback resumes after error states
- **UI Organization**: 
  - Bottom-left: Playlist button
  - Bottom-right: Aspect ratio, orientation, settings buttons
  - Controller auto-hides after timeout, channel info stays visible
- **Debug Log Toggle**: Already exists in Settings page (show/hide on-screen debug logs)

### October 5, 2025 (Version 1.3 - CRASH FIX)
- **ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL FIX: Theme Crash Resolved** - Fixed MaterialCardView crash by changing app theme from `Theme.AppCompat` to `Theme.MaterialComponents` (root cause: MaterialCardView requires MaterialComponents theme)

### October 5, 2025 (Version 1.2 - Bug Fixes & Logo Update)
- **CRITICAL FIX: Playlist loading crash** - Fixed RecyclerView update timing to prevent crashes with all playlist sizes
- **Error Recovery**: App now clears corrupted playlists automatically on startup with proper try-catch handling
- **Logo Display**: Logo only appears on app start screen - automatically hides during channel playback

### October 3, 2025 (HLS Audio Detection + Codec Priority Fix)
- **CRITICAL FIX: HLS Media Source for MPEG Audio Detection** âœ… WORKING
  - Root cause: MPEG audio tracks not detected in HLS transport streams
  - Solution: HlsMediaSource.Factory with DefaultHlsExtractorFactory
  - Aggressive TS flags: FLAG_DETECT_ACCESS_UNITS, FLAG_ENABLE_HDMV_DTS_AUDIO_STREAMS
  - Disabled chunkless preparation to force full playlist parsing
  - Fixed "NO AUDIO TRACKS IN STREAM" issue for MPEG audio layers 1/2
- **Codec Priority: Built-in First, FFmpeg Fallback**
  - Hardware/MediaCodec decoders used by default (optimal performance)
  - FFmpeg audio renderer available for unsupported formats (MP2, etc.)
  - EXTENSION_RENDERER_MODE_ON: Built-in preferred, FFmpeg as fallback
  - Battery-efficient hardware acceleration when available
- **Modern Architecture**: 
  - Lifecycle-aware coroutines (lifecycleScope) for playlist loading
  - Proper cleanup in onStop() to prevent handler leaks
  - Dedicated FfmpegRenderersFactory with smart codec selection
  - HLS-specific media source factory for IPTV streams
- **Phone-only UI**: Single tap to play, grey background for currently playing channel
- **Float audio output**: 32-bit float PCM for high-quality audio
- **Subtitles disabled**: Text renderer completely removed
- **Buffering timeout**: 30s detection with user notification
- **Enhanced diagnostics**: Track detection, codec names, format details (resolution, framerate, sample rate, bitrate)
- **Aspect ratio control**: On-screen button to cycle through display modes (FIT/FILL/ZOOM) for 4:3 and 16:9 content
- **HTTP headers**: User-Agent and proper headers (Accept, Accept-Encoding) for IPTV server compatibility
- **Enhanced error reporting**: Detailed error codes and causes logged for debugging

### October 1, 2025
- Initial Android project with Media3/ExoPlayer integration
- M3U8 playlist parser for IPTV support
- Manual playlist loader (upload file or load from URL)
- Channel logos and categories support
- Enhanced error recovery and network handling
